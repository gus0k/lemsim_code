"""
This module deals with priors from players.
All data related to priors is stored in the main player dictionary.

Priors are assumed to be normal - normal (known deviation, unknown mu)

The relevant fields are as following:

Suffix used are: 
    qb (quantity buying),
    qs (quantity selling), 
    ps (price selling),
    pb (price buying),

key: `priors_{suffix}`
    Numpy array of shape (N, 3) where
    N is the number of different priors the player.
    
    First column represents player's mu
    Second column represents player's sigma
    Third column represents the known sigma

key `freq`. Integer: number of samples required before
    updating.

key `queue_{suffix}`
    List of deque (queues) where the samples
    are stored before they are processed. This is used
    together with the update frequency `freq`.

ket `slot2prior`
    List of integers of length equal to the number of slots
    in the simulation.
    Maps each time-slot with one of the priors.

key `price`
    Numpy array of size (Time-slots, 7)
    Each row stands for [price selling TEC, price sellig market, price buying market, price buying TEC, quant selling market, 0, quant buying market].
